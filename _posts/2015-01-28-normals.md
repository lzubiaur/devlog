title: Sprite light effect with cocos2d-x
---

[Normal mapping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_mapping) is a technique to create dynamic light or "lamp effect" on 3D objects or 2D sprites like in the demo video below.

A normal map is a static image used to defined the bumps or reliefs on a flat 2D sprite. The normal map is made with an editor and then loaded at runtime by the game to produce this dynamic "lamp effect".

To build the normal map I used [Sprite DLight](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2dee/sprite-dlight-instant-normal-maps-for-2d-graphics) but there are other cool editors out there like [Sprite Lamp](http://www.snakehillgames.com/spritelamp/) and [Sprite Illuminator](https://www.codeandweb.com/spriteilluminator)

Once created the normal map still has to be passed to a shader program to actually render the effect dynamically. 

Since version 3 cocos2d-x comes with a normal map shader test available in the *EffectNormalMapped* class in ShaderTest2.cpp. You can now use that class to quickly implement your own lamp effect for your games!
