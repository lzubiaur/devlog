title: Dynamic light with Box2d and cocos2d-x
---

For an upcoming game I'm currently working on I made some dynamic light tests using Box2d and cocos2d-x v2. I was inspired by [this tutorial](http://gamemechanicexplorer.com/#raycasting-2) and [this one](http://ncase.me/sight-and-light/) too. Here is a demo video with 3 light sources.

### The code

I implemented the light using Box2d [raycasting](http://www.iforce2d.net/b2dtut/raycasting) to build a "map" of the light (screenshot 1 and 2 below) and then use that map with a [CCClippingNode](http://www.cocos2d-x.org/reference/native-cpp/V3.3/d2/d06/classcocos2d_1_1_clipping_node.html) to mask the light sprite (screenshot 3).

The dyn light code mainly do the following.

1. Ray-cast from the light source towards each polygon vertices (actually 3 ray-casts for each vertices. See [Issues](#{{ page.id }}-1))
2. Ray-cast against each screen corners.
3. Collect the closest ray-cast hit points and sort them clockwise
4. Remove duplicate points (see [Issues](#{{ page.id }}-1))
5. Triangulate the light map and create the mask texture (see [this previous post about texture triangulation]({{ site.baseurl }}/2014/01/27/texture-polygon/))
7. Update the CCClippingNode object with the mask texture

## <a id="{{page.id}}-1"></a>Issues

The main challenge was to make sure the ray-cast actually hit the polygon vertices. Indeed Box2D ray-casting might miss fixtures on "sharp" angles so I had to ray-cast against the polygon vertex but also against a point projected towards the polygon center. Another point projected outside the polygon is also required to hit the screen edge.

Another annoying issue was to get rid of the duplicates ray-cast hit points. This was solved using [std::unique](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/unique) and a custom predicate to compare points and remove points that are too close.

{% highlight cpp %}
bool pred(const CCPoint &a, const CCPoint &b)
{
    /// Remove point that are too close (less than one pixel)
    return fabs(a.x - b.x) < 1.f && fabs(a.y - b.y) < 1.f;
}
{% endhighlight %}

### TODO

* Port the code to cocos2d-x v3 
* For the moment the code only works for polygon and I have to provide support for other box2d shapes (circle and edge)
* Stress testing and clean up the code
